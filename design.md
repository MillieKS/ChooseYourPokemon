# {{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Class System

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ MusicPlayer                │
│                            │
│ - tracks                   │
│ - add(track)               │
│ - search_by_title(keyword) │
│   => [tracks...]           │
└───────────┬────────────────┘
            │
            │ owns a list of
            ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Track(title, artist)    │
│                         │
│ - title                 │
│ - artist                │
│ - format()              │
│   => "TITLE by ARTIST"  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

_Also design the interface of each class in more detail._

```python
class TopTrumps:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player1 = []
        self.computer = []
        self.player1_deck_size = 20
        self.computer_deck_size = 20
        self.rounds_of_play = 10
    
    def random_pokemon(self):
        return api.random_pokemon()


    def pick_stat_attribute(self, player):
    # Implement logic to allow the player to choose a stat attribute


    def computer_pokemon(self):
        # Generate a random Pokémon for the computer and show it to player 1

    def game(self):
    for round in range(self.rounds_of_play):
        # Get player's chosen attribute
        player_attribute = self.pick_stat_attribute(self.player1)
        # Get computer's chosen attribute
        computer_attribute = self.pick_stat_attribute(self.computer)

        # Compare the attributes and determine the round winner
        if player_attribute > computer_attribute:
            # Player 1 wins the round
            # Implement logic to exchange cards and update deck sizes
        elif player_attribute < computer_attribute:
            # Computer wins the round
            # Implement logic to exchange cards and update deck sizes
        else:
            # It's a tie, implement tie-breaker logic if necessary



api.py

import random
import requests

def random_pokemon():
    pokemon_number = random.randint(1, 151)
    url = 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{}/'.format(pokemon_number)
    response = requests.get(url)
    print(response)
    pokemon = response.json()
    stats = {
    'name': pokemon['name'],
    'id': pokemon['id'],
    'height': pokemon['height'],
    'weight': pokemon['weight'],
    }
    return stats

    
#class Track:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   title: string
    #   artist: string

    #def __init__(self, title, artist):
        # Parameters:
        #   title: string
        #   artist: string
        # Side-effects:
        #   Sets the title and artist properties
        pass # No code here yet

    #def format(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string of the form "TITLE by ARTIST"
        pass # No code here yet

```

## 3. Create Examples as Integration Tests

_Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and
combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a library
When we add two tracks
We see those tracks reflected in the tracks list
"""
# library = MusicLibrary()
# track_1 = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
# track_2 = Track("Synaesthesia", "The Thrillseekers")
# library.add(track_1)
# library.add(track_2)
# library.tracks # => [track_1, track_2]
```

## 4. Create Examples as Unit Tests

_Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at
a more granular level of detail._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a track with a title and an artist
We see the title reflected in the title property
"""
track = Track("Carte Blanche", "Veracocha")
track.title # => "Carte Blanche"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 5. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green,
refactor to implement the behaviour._
